# 🚚 AmazonDeliveryTimePrediction
A machine learning project that predicts delivery times using factors like distance, traffic, weather, area, and agent details. Built with Python, scikit-learn, and MLflow; deployed via Streamlit for real-time ETA predictions.

📝 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting the estimated delivery time (ETA) for Amazon orders using various factors such as order details, agent characteristics, traffic, weather conditions, and geospatial data.
By applying machine learning regression models, this project aims to improve delivery time estimation, which is crucial for:

* ⏱️Enhancing customer experience through accurate ETAs

* 🚀Optimizing delivery operations and route planning

* 📈 Improving agent performance analysis and resource allocation

Key Contributions

* 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand delivery patterns

* 🧮 Feature Engineering (distance calculations, temporal patterns, categorical encoding)

* Training Multiple Regression Models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

* 🧪 Experiment Tracking with MLflow for model comparison and reproducibility

* 🖼️ Streamlit UI Integration for interactive ETA predictions
